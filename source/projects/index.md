## Rakun.js [beta]

While everyone's got tired of the current state of javascript, I've decided to develop my very own, minimalistic front-end framework with old-school approach (zero dependency and no fancy solutions not widely supported by common browsers). 
It can be easily integrated with existing solutions e.g. jQuery and jQuery plugins without any dedicated library modifications.

## Inku.js [early alpha]

A Node.js-based static site generator with web interface. FTP deployments, markdown editor with inline image uploader and json-based search feature (on generated static website) will be included.

## Scaffolder [beta]

Inspired by Ruby on Rails scaffolding generator I've decided to build my own one, for [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com) in 1.0.2 version at the time of writing it. To achieve such objective, I've decided to use bash and write it as a straighforward function. 
It was a double-goal project for me, because I've learned some basics of writing bash shell scripts.
