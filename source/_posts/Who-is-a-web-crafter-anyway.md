As You can see in couple places on this website that I calling myself as a web crafter. 

What the hell?

## With time goes experience

I'm making various things on the web since early 2005 (comercially it's 2009). 
When I was starting iframes and `<marquee>` tags were *the thing* (a.k.a. hype). Whole pages were built on table grids and inline styles were not that bad (and how now history shows it really isn't - see some react-based projects :P ).

Time passed and I've learned about cascade styling sheets and incoming new, HTML standards. Most of my projects were based on slicing Photoshop's `psd` files to static templates.
Then I started learning about Wordpress theming and deploying everything to remote servers. I've become a full-stack developer :D

In 2011 I've learnt about Ruby and Rails framework. I was trying to switch to backend development only. After 2 years of trying to achieve that, I've switched back to front - it was the thing that gives me more fun.

Luckily, Node.js has become more and more popular, so as long I was into javascript I decided to give it a try. Since 2013,apart from freelancing,- I was developing mini side project that eventually were deployed into bottom of my drawer ;) 
You can laugh, but experience gained during all those years is priceless. In my opinion, every developer should try new things apart from full-time job. It opens Your mind and makes You better developer. 

And remember, a good developer is not necessary a person, whom code is like highest state of art, but who is

## getting the shit done

Yeah, that's right. Who cares that Your code has 100% code coverage but no business value? That doesn't mean of course that You shouldn't care about its quality. But as long You don't have to (for example when You are making Your very own side-project) You don't need to bahave like an evangelist.
Most of side projects stays in the baby-steps stage, because of the burning out effect.

Your little project don't have to be perfect.

Just ship something.

I can assure You, that every iteration shipped will cause also huge dopamine injection caused by self-pride and satisfaction of achievement/finishing something.
