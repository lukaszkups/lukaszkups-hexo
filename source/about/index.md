## lukaszkups - a Poland-based web crafter

Welcome to my [Hexo powered](http://hexo.io) website.

This is my personal web space, where I save/share my thoughts, ideas & experience.

Currently I'm a JavaScript web developer available for hire or full-time employment - Pozna≈Ñ (Poland) or remote.

I build stuff using [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) for mobile.

If You want to know more about my experience - please take a look at my [linkedin profile](http://linkedin.com/in/lukaszkups), [github profile](http://github.com/lukaszkups) or [projects page](/projects/).

In my spare time I [blog](/archives/) about tech-related stuff or commit code to my open-source [repositories](/projects/).

I have also experience in working with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) powered apps, which provides me APIs for creating beautiful, useful frontend interfaces. Creating custom [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) templates is no magic for me either.

If You are interested in working together, feel free to contact me via [twitter](http://twitter.com/lukaszkups) or [e-mail](mailto:letstalk@lukaszkups.net).
