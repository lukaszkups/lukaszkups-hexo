## lukaszkups - a Poland-based web crafter

Welcome to my [Hexo powered](http://hexo.io) website.

This is my personal web space, where I save/share my thoughts, ideas & experience.

Currently I work at [ITM Business](http://itm.biz.pl) as a javascript developer and in my spare time I freelance and write about tech-related stuff at [lukaszkups.net](http://lukaszkups.net).

I build stuff using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) with [Intel XDK](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk), [npm scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/) (task runners free) and pure, beloved [javascript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript) (framework free!).

I have also experience in working with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) powered apps, which provides me APIs for creating beautiful, useful frontend interfaces. Creating custom [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) templates is no magic for me either.

If You are interested in working together, feel free to contact me via [twitter](http://twitter.com/lukaszkups) or [e-mail](mailto:letstalk@lukaszkups.net).
