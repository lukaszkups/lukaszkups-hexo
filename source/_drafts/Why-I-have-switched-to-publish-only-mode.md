## Too much conent in the online paradise

I've found that I spend way too much consuming things on the internet. I follow (too) many social media accounts, that share things that I'm interested in (programming, webdesign, product design, entrenepreteurship, movies, music etc.).

So I decided to cut my twitter (that's my main source of content) following list to 40 accounts.

And that was year ago.

After some time, I've found that 40 accounts still publish too much content, so I've cut it again - this time to 20 accounts.

I think it seems to be better now, but sometimes there are days when it is still too much.

I've decided to keep the current state of my following list(to stay relevant what's going on in the industry) but now, every time before I click on the link I ask myself if I'm really interested in that topic - I've never do something like that before - I was just clicking and consuming more and more content.

It works somehow, but still I want to keep improving it and cut consuming content close to zero.

Some time ago, [I've learnt](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/the-reality-of-developer-burnout) that the goal I want to achieve has a name.

## Publish-only mode

A publish-only mode is an approach of working with social media that forces user to create content, not consume it. 

It helps to focus on actual work and remove unnecessary distractions.
